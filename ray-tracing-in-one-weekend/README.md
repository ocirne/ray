# Ray Tracing in One Weekend in Kotlin

This is a direkt C++ to Kotlin translation from the Books on [Ray Tracing](https://raytracing.github.io/) with minimal changes.
This is most probably not good Kotlin code.


## Notes on optimization

Using in vec3 direct x, y, z fields instead of e: 370 s -> 199 s.

Changing Double -> Float: slower, 199 s -> 218 s, reverted.


# License

As my own contribution apart from the translation is low the same license applies.
